# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal porfolio website. It is build using <b>Next.js</b> and <b>TailwindCSS</b>. It is hosted on <b>Vercel</b>. The website was build using ideas from [Wesley (ByteGrad)](https://github.com/ByteGrad/portfolio-website). 

This website served as a learning experience for me to learn TailwindCSS, hooks, ContextProviders and many more things. 

I will be adding a blog section to this website soon. They will be written in markdown and will be hosted on the same website. I will share my experiences and learnings in the blog section. Do suggest me some topics that you would like me to write about and any improvements that you would like to see in the website.

Feel free to look at the code and use it for your own website.
